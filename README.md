# FarmTimer
2 Timers that run via user inputted amount of seconds and alternate, named "farm" and "loot" timer. Created for the intended use for the game "Maplestory"

In the game "Maplestory", longtime players will "farm" in the game, which consists of constantly defeating monsters that drop currency called "mesos". These drops fall on the ground and disappear in a time span of 2 minutes. In order to optimize and balance out the time to defeat the monsters and spend time collecting the drops, I have created a "farm timer" that keeps track of when to defeat monsters/collect loot based on the active timer being portrayed.

For user freedom, I have allowed the user to input any cumulative amount of seconds, in the case they would like to utilize the program for other purposes.

IMPROVEMENTS:
In terms of design, the biggest problem is that there needs to be more emphasis on which timer is being active. At the moment, it's impossible to tell which timer is counting down.
One suggestion would be to create a new label that has an animation to indicate the user that the timer has alternated to the other.
Another suggestion to implement would be a sound that pings the player to let them know it's time to loot/farm. Of course, this sound is optional, and can be toggled on/off by the user.

If possible, I would like to expand this page to be exported easily and perhaps add more features outside a timer that would assist a Maplestory player's management in-game. Ideally, I would like to create a universal management tool for this game.
